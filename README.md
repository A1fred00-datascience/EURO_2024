# Euro 2024 Winner Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the winner of the Euro 2024 football tournament using machine learning techniques. The prediction is based on historical match data, team and player statistics, FIFA rankings, and other relevant features.

## Strategy
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered historical data from previous Euro tournaments, team and player statistics from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data, performed feature engineering to create meaningful inputs for the model.
3. **Model Selection**: Experimented with different machine learning models and selected the best-performing one.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics.
5. **Prediction**: Used the trained model to predict the outcome of Euro 2024 matches and determine the tournament winner.
6. **Data Visualization**: Visualized the data and prediction results using Python libraries.

## Implementation
- **Python Libraries**: Used Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- **Data Sources**: Utilized historical match data, team and player statistics from various websites.
- **Model Building**: Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict match outcomes.
- **Prediction**: Predicted the winner of Euro 2024 based on the trained model.
- **Data Visualization**: Created visualizations to display model performance and predictions.
